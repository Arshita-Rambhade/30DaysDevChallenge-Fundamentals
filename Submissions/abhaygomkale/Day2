arr=[9, 6, 4, 2, 3, 5, 7, 0, 1]
siz=len(arr)+1
x=0
for i in range(siz):
    x=x^i

y=0
for i in arr:
    y=y^i

missingValue=x^y
print(missingValue)

Missing Value is 8

As instructed in the explanation, I used the bitwise XOR approach.

1)First, I calculated the length of the array. Since one number is missing, the total count should be len(arr) + 1, which is n.
2)I found the XOR of all numbers from 0 to n and stored it in x.
3)Then, I calculated the XOR of all elements in the given array and stored it in y.
4) the missing number is obtained by x ^ y
