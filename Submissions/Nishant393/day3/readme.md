Welcome to my submission for Day 3 of the 30 Days Dev Challenge – Fundamentals.

shortest path for A to F : A > C > F

## Task Summary

We are given a directed, weighted graph representing a network of servers.  
Each edge has a latency (in milliseconds). Our goal:

Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from `A` to `F`.
